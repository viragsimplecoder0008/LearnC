#include <stdio.h> // Get the standard input-output library, which includes printf.

int main() { // Declare/define the main function
    printf("Hello World!"); // Print hello world to the console. (Every statment in C MUST end with a semi-colon, like you see here.)
    return 0; // Makes sure the program gives the output as success.
} // End the main function.
